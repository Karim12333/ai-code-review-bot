- [ ] Update Railway environment variables:
  - [ ] `GITHUB_APP_ID=123456`
  - [ ] `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64=your-base64-key`
- [ ] Redeploy backend on Railway

### 7. Install GitHub App

### 9. Update Frontend Links (Optional)
- [ ] Edit `frontend/components/Hero.tsx`
- [ ] Update "Install the GitHub App" link to your App's installation URL
- [ ] Redeploy frontend

## Testing & Validation

### 10. End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Create a test repository or use existing one
- [ ] Ensure GitHub App is installed on the repository
- [ ] Create a new branch with some code changes
- [ ] Open a Pull Request
- [ ] Wait for AI review comment (usually 30-60 seconds)
- [ ] Verify comment appears with `<!-- ai-review-bot -->` marker

### 11. Test Different Scenarios
- [ ] Test PR with no significant changes (should get minimal review)
- [ ] Test PR with security issues (should flag them)
- [ ] Test PR with style issues (should provide suggestions)
- [ ] Push additional commits to same PR (should update existing comment)

## Configuration & Customization

### 12. Repository Configuration (Optional)
- [ ] Create `.aicodereview.yml` in target repository root
- [ ] Customize review rules (severity, focus areas, ignored files)
- [ ] Test with new PR to verify custom rules work

### 13. Monitoring & Maintenance
- [ ] Check Railway logs for any errors
- [ ] Monitor OpenAI API usage and costs
- [ ] Set up alerts for webhook failures (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions
- [ ] **"Invalid signature" error**: Check webhook secret matches in GitHub App and Railway
- [ ] **"401 Unauthorized"**: Verify GitHub App permissions and private key
- [ ] **"No review posted"**: Check Railway logs, verify OpenAI API key has credits
- [ ] **Frontend build errors**: Ensure Node.js 18+ and run `npm install`

## Going Live

### 14. Production Readiness
- [ ] Test with multiple repositories
- [ ] Verify error handling works
- [ ] Check performance with large PRs
- [ ] Document usage for team members

### 15. Sharing & Promotion
